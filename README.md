# Smart-Resistance-Band-App
The Smart Resistance Band App pairs with a sensor-equipped resistance band to track force output and time under tension. It provides real-time feedback, progress tracking, and performance analytics through a user-friendly iOS application.


**Features**  
- Real-time tracking of force and tension duration  
- Data visualization for performance insights  
- Competitive mode to compare stats with others  
- Historical progress tracking to monitor improvements  
- Seamless Bluetooth connectivity for live updates  

**Tech Stack**  
- **iOS App**: Swift, SwiftUI  
- **Hardware**: Force sensors embedded in resistance bands  
- **Backend**: Firebase (for data storage & analytics)  
- **Connectivity**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
